Stabilize ownership, clean data, and extend dashboard UI.

Highlights
- Fix misattributed posts: prefer post.shared_by + profile.username (per sources/me.json), persist ownerKey/ownerId/ownerHandle.
- Reconcile per selected user: move on explicit mismatch; reclaim from unknown; remove empty posts; add concise logs.
- Replace “Total …” filtered labels with unprefixed labels; add All Posts (unfiltered) totals row (views/likes/replies/remixes/interactions) and move Total followers onto that row.
- New chart: All Posts cumulative views over time.
- Time axis: show time-of-day when multiple ticks share a day; tooltips include date+time.
- Tooltips: edge-aware flipping (pin to left of cursor if near right edge) without drift/wrap.
- Replies formatting: 2 decimals for K/M; no decimals below 1K.

Notes
- Cleanup runs only for the selected user to keep refresh fast.
- Logs: [Dashboard] reconciled/moved/pruned entries for traceability.
