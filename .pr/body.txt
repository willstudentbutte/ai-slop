Fix misattributed posts, remove empty posts, and align owner parsing.

Changes
- Owner parsing: prefer post.shared_by (id) + profile.username (handle) per me.json.
- Persist ownerKey/ownerHandle/ownerId on posts as snapshots arrive.
- Reconcile (selected user only): move away on explicit mismatch; infer current user when owner is missing; reclaim from 'unknown'.
- Prune empty posts for selected user (no snapshots or all-null metrics).
- Hide noisy sorting logs; add reconciliation/pruning logs.

Notes
- Scoped to the selected user to keep refresh fast.
- Emits concise [Dashboard] logs for traceability.
